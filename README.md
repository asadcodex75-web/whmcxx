# NovaHost WHMCS Template

A dark, neon-accented WHMCS template kit tailored for hosting providers. The suite includes a polished homepage, catalog-style store, dedicated pages for shared hosting, managed VPS, bare-metal servers, an order form wizard, and a client-area login/register experience.

## Pages

- **index.html** – Hero-led homepage introducing the NovaHost suite with testimonials and metrics.
- **store.html** – Product catalog featuring shared, VPS, dedicated, and add-on templates.
- **hosting.html** – Shared hosting landing page with feature highlights and plan cards.
- **vps.html** – Managed VPS showcase with comparison table.
- **dedicated.html** – Dedicated server catalog and data-centre overview.
- **order.html** – Multi-step order form ready for WHMCS integration.
- **auth.html** – Split login/register card for the client area.

## Styling

All styles are centralised inside `assets/css/style.css`. Adjust CSS variables at the top of the file to rebrand the palette quickly.

## Usage

Open any HTML file in a browser or drop the markup into your WHMCS template directory (`/templates/{your-template}/`). Link the shared stylesheet and update navigation URLs to match your installation paths.
